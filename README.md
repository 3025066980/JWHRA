# JWHRA
This repository simulates JWHRA algorithm in LTE-A wireless networks. JHWRA algorithm is a MAC layer resource allocation algorithm for green power base stations with user equipments equipped with wireless chargin devices. Our simulations indicate that by using our proposed algorithms, the energy efficiency can improve 15% compared to traditional LTE-A networks.
